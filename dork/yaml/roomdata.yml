  cell:
    ROOM_NAME: 'cell'
    DESCRIPTION: |
      You find yourself in a jail cell with the door locked.
      As you look outside the bars, you can see a corridor extending in
      either direction. For now, you need to get out of here. Upon further
      inspection in the room, you note various shackles and torture
      instruments, a metal bed suspended from the wall with a chain, but
      nothing more.
    INSPECT: |
      Upon checking under the bed, you find a key. How convenient
      for you, prisoner!

  Jail hallway:
    ROOM_NAME: 'Jail Hallway'
    DESCRIPTION: |
      A long, narrow hallway lined with cells and torches for light on
      either side. To your immediate left, there is a crumbling wall.
      Perhaps if you had something that could help destroy it...
      To your right, down the corridor, there is a stairwell. The stairs
      lead up, but it is completely pitch black inside. You'll probably
      trip and hurt yourself without a source of light. You should be
      able to reach up and remove one of the torches from the wall.

  Stairwell:
    ROOM_NAME: 'Stairwell'
    DESCRIPTION: |
      Using the torch, you are able to see that the stairwell
      is decrepit and many steps have chunks missing, with others having
      pieces of rubble on them. You make your way carefully up the stairs and
      emerge at the top.

  Jail Tower:
    ROOM_NAME: 'Jail Tower'
    DESCRIPTION: |
      As you exit the stairwell and go outside, you find yourself atop a
      tower. It is raining hard and a storm is currently ongoing. You
      hear the sounds of thunder and see bright flashes of lightning
      every now and then. As you look over the edge of the tower,
      you see nothing but a raging ocean.
    INSPECT: |
      As you look around on top of the tower, you note that
      there is an iron bar leaned up against the wall, near the door you
      emerged from. You take the iron bar. It is cold in your hands and
      wet from the rain, but otherwise sturdy.

  Jail Armory:
    ROOM_NAME: 'Jail Armory'
    DESCRIPTION: |
      You enter the armory and note that the armor and weapon
      racks are all but empty. You also note the presence of a few target
      dummies and archery targets.
    INSPECT: |
      One of the dummies has a sword embedded in it. You are able
      to pull the sword from the dummy with a little effort.
